# Version Numbering Parts (SEMVER)
SEMVER means Semantic Versioning.

For example, you might see in your package.json:
```
"express": "^4.18.2"
```
Imagine it like this, X.Y.Z. Which X is for major changes, Y is for minor changes, and Z is for bug fix.

## Tilde & Caret Shorthand
Node.js implementation of semver also introduces shorthand ranges: `~` (tilde) and `^` (caret). The general explanation for how these work is:

- Prefixing a single semver version string with the `~` character defines a range of acceptable versions that include all patch versions from the one specified up to, but not including, the next minor version. `~1.2.3` can be approximately expanded as `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0`.

- Prefixing a single semver version string with the `^` character defines a range of acceptable versions that include all patch and minor versions from the ones specified up to, but not including, the next version. So `^1.2.3` can be approximately expanded as `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0`.
